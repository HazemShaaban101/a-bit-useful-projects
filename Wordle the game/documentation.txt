this game is a cs50 assignment, it is not entirely made by me, nor it is owned by anyone.

To run the game, double click on the run file, and type "wordle.exe <number between 5 and 8>"
the number you choose will be the number of letters of the word you will be trying to find.

color codes:

RED 	===> letter not present in the word
YELLOW 	===> letter present, but its not the right place
GREEN	===> letter is in the correct place in the word


hope you enjoy!
